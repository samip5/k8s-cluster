## :open_file_folder:&nbsp; Repository structure

The Git repository contains the following directories under `cluster` and are ordered below by how Flux will apply them.

- **flux** directory is the entrypoint to Flux
- **bootstrap** directory contains a simple Kustomize resource to deploy Flux to an empty cluster
- **charts** directory contains all of my different chart repos
- **crds** directory contains custom resource definitions (CRDs) that need to exist globally in my cluster before anything else exists
- **config** directory contains cluster-wide configs like global variables
- **core** directory (depends on **crds**) are important infrastructure applications (grouped by namespace) that should never be pruned by Flux
- **apps** directory (depends on **core**) is where my common applications (grouped by namespace) are placed.

## Network

All nodes are connected to a dual-stack network, with private IPv4 and public IPv6.  
Kubernetes nodes are on their own VLAN which has access to the NAS.

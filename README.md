## :open_file_folder:&nbsp; Repository structure

The Git repository contains the following directories under `cluster` and are ordered below by how Flux will apply them.

- **base** directory is the entrypoint to Flux
- **crds** directory contains custom resource definitions (CRDs) that need to exist globally in your cluster before anything else exists
- **core** directory (depends on **crds**) are important infrastructure applications (grouped by namespace) that should never be pruned by Flux
- **apps** directory (depends on **core**) is where your common applications (grouped by namespace) could be placed, Flux will prune resources here if they are not tracked by Git anymore

## Network

All nodes are connected to a dual-stack network, with private IPv4 and public IPv6.  
Kubernetes nodes are on their own VLAN which has access to the NAS.
